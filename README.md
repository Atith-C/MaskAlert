# Face Mask Detection


## 📖 Overview

Face Mask Detection is an AI-driven project designed to identify individuals wearing or not wearing masks in real-time. Using deep learning techniques, the model analyzes images or video streams and detects compliance with mask-wearing protocols to enhance public safety.

## ✨ Features

- **High Accuracy:** Achieved over 95% accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Real-Time Detection:** Integrates with OpenCV for real-time mask detection on live video feeds.
- **Cross-Platform:** Deployable as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
- **Customizable:** Easy to adapt for various use cases, including workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Deep Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Web Framework:** Flask, Streamlit
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle
